I need to make the user based on cookies work which is something I currently do not know how to do. 

Can this be based on their IP? or does it need to be assigned when the page first loads? 

Cookeis can be created when the user goes to the website. This can be easly googled. Once the cookie is created it can last for two weeks which is a play period. This also makes me want to add an optional log in feature for better user memory.

The recomending system will need to happen in the backend and instead of sending all the data at once maybe it should send only a couple and then reorder baced
